Introduction 
As the U.S. urban markets gradually 
regain momentum, we foresee a 
surge in fund allocations toward 
retail by institutional investors 
in 2024. Retailers are prime for 
expansion, eager to seize new 
market opportunities and increase 
their market share. Our research 
indicates that 47% of retailers plan 
to further establish their footprint 
in 2024, identifying innovative 
channels to boost sales and 
minimize operational expenses.
Despite the shift in spending 
priorities, we predict that consumers 
will gradually come to terms 
with the inevitable price hikes 
triggered by inflation. We anticipate 
that the “micro indulgences” 
trend will hold its ground.  
2024 is gearing up to be a retail 
revivification as the focus shifts 
from store closures to openings. 
What’s driving the growth? Where
is the demand originating, and is 
the supply adequate to meet it? 
We answer these questions and 
more in our Winter Retail Report.

Navigating the Economy in the New Year
Recapping 2023 and Entering 2024 
In the third quarter of 2023, the U.S. economy 
surged with a remarkable annual GDP growth 
rate of 4.9%, driven by robust consumer spending 
and inventory investment. However, concerns 
loom over the economy’s future path due to 
impending challenges, including the possibility of 
a government shutdown, resumption of student 
loan repayments and geopolitical tensions. In 
addition, tighter fiscal and monetary policies, 
coupled with reduced excess savings, are expected 
to strain economic growth. As a result, Oxford 
Economics anticipates a modest GDP growth of 
just 0.2% in 2024, followed by a slightly improved 
1.6% in 2025.
Consumer spending, a significant driver of the 
U.S. economy, exhibited strength in September, 
with a 0.7% surge in overall spending, evenly 
distributed between goods and services. Inflation, 
as measured by the Consumer Price Index, 
remained elevated at 3.7% in September, with 
core inflation showing a trend toward disinflation. 
Labor market data for September exceeded 
expectations, raising the possibility of service-
sector inflation reversal and potential interest 
rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. However, the 
recent increase in female labor force participation 
rates could enhance the economy’s supply-side 
capacity, potentially leading to a soft landing.
Despite a rate increase in July, the Fed chose 
not to raise rates in September and November, 
signaling a “higher for longer” approach. Oxford 
Economics predicts a rate cut beginning in the 
second half of 2024, with a gradual reduction 
path. Overall, the third quarter of 2023 is likely 
the peak of the economic expansion, as a 
cooling labor market, eroding savings, inflation 
and higher interest rates are expected to curb 
consumer spending. This scenario increases the 
chances of a mild recession in 2024.
Considered consumption
Consumers will remain considerate in their 
purchasing habits; this means researching prices and 
products and using a more comprehensive number 
of retailers to get the right product and price.
Experience economy
When it comes to discretionary purchases, 
more consumers will want experience to be a part 
of the purchasing process – this will be an essential 
way of strengthening value for money perceptions.
High-low buying
Consumers will try to save money on more 
essential items by trading down to value channels 
and products; this is both to reduce spending and so 
they can trade up on things they want.
Micro indulgence
Even though finances are tighter, people’s 
sense of entitlement around indulging themselves 
will remain strong, focusing on small treats and 
indulgences to satisfy this need.
Polarization
With modest retail growth, there will be 
increased polarization between winners and losers 
within the retail sector; strong retailers will stay 
caught up.
Automation
Retail costs and margins are under more 
pressure, so retailers will look to reduce their 
expenses by automating processes where they can, 
most likely using artificial intelligence.

Retail Capital Markets Outlook
The retail asset class has generally been ranked 
lower in asset allocation relative to multifamily 
and industrial. However, with strong fundamentals 
— low vacancies, limited new development and 
rising rents — not to mention higher going-in 
cap rates, it is gaining some attention. Retailers 
that have survived the post-housing-bust fallout 
and the pandemic have adapted to the changing 
landscape, making them stronger tenants overall 
and adding to retail’s attractiveness.
Retail drove 18% of all sales volume in the 
third quarter of 2023, the highest share since 
2018. Investors are likely underweight to retail 
exposure. While it is unlikely that retail will see 
a 30% share as it did in the early 2000s, there 
is room for it to take on a larger share of the 
investment market in the near term.
Retailer Plans & Forecast
More Stores in 2024
Retailers have expansion plans in mind, with the intent to open more stores 
than they plan to close. Of the top twenty-five hot retailers designated 
by the National Retail Federation (NRF), grocery and apparel stores in 
particular are making moves into new markets, among them newcomers 
Chedraui and Primark, as well as Raley’s and the Schwarz Group. The 
adaptability of the retail industry is demonstrated by the agility of both 
retailers and investors in swiftly adjusting to shifts in consumer behavior. 
Growth remains robust, and we expect retailers to sustain their expansion 
efforts as they seek to increase geographical reach and market saturation.

Omnichannel remains a key investment area 
for retailers as expansion also boosts retailers’ 
strategy. Research has found that companies 
with extremely strong omnichannel customer 
engagement retain 89% of customers on average, 
compared to just 33% for retailers with weaker 
omnichannel customer engagement.
Creativity is expected to play a pivotal role in 
shaping the future of omnichannel experiences. 
Authentic omnichannel consumers seamlessly 
interact with retailers across various platforms 
throughout their journeys. Google’s research 
reveals that 48% of global consumers discover 
inspiration for their purchases online. Eliminating 
the boundaries between the research and 
purchase phases will be fundamental in achieving 
retail success in the forthcoming years.

In addition, retailers also plan to invest heavily in 
automation within their stores and warehouses 
over the next few years to boost operational 
efficiency, leading to reduced costs and higher 
profits. Walmart announced earlier in the year 
that about 55% of packages processed through 
its fulfillment centers will be moved through 
automated facilities by January 2026, improving 
unit cost averages by about 20%. Deployments of 
artificial intelligence are also projected to increase, 
and the use of AI to improve operations is expected 
to increase nine-fold in the next two years.

Driving Sales Growth  
in 2024
The crazy highs and lows of the 
past few years are gone, and 
retail sales will normalize to pre-
pandemic trends. Most retailers 
feel that the challenging trading 
environment of 2023 will persist 
into 2024. Moreover, nearly 40% 
of retailers believe that trading 
will be more challenging in 2024 
than in 2023, while just under 
a third feel it will be about the 
same. E-commerce is expected to 
be the driving force behind retail 
sales for the foreseeable future, 
accounting for 20% of total retail 
sales by 2027. 
Retail trends are transforming, heavily influenced 
by the preferences and values of younger 
generations, shaping a shift towards digital 
engagement and experiential shopping. Next 
year, U.S. retail social commerce sales will total 
$82.82 billion, growing 23.5% year-over-year.  
Gen Z will drive this growth as they are more likely 
to purchase via social platforms than the majority 
of the population.
“Next year, U.S. retail

Bigger ticket categories like

categories like apparel will 
likely see the greatest sales 
decline. Essential retailers, 
like supermarkets, have 
more optimism about sales 
in 2024, especially with their 
share of online sales growth. 
In addition, what people buy 
online is shifting; essential 
categories like grocery,

increasing their percentage of

Costs to Rise in 2024
Almost two-thirds of retailers feel their costs 
will rise in 2024. While supply chain challenges 
have eased over the past year, relatively few 
retailers think costs will fall in 2024 as the sector 
grapples with inflation, rising energy prices and 
labor shortages. On the bright side, inflation 
should continue to ease, falling to around 2.5% 
by the end of 2024, and a slowdown in inflation 
will bolster retail volume growth by 6.7% in U.S. 
dollar terms in 2024.

Challenges Ahead, but Optimism is Warranted
Sales volume and margins will be the primary 
concerns for retailers in 2024. The simple 
reality for many is that inflation’s prolonged 
and compounding effects mean consumers are 
spending more for less volume. Prices of goods 
have increased so dramatically in the last two 
years that consumers globally are spending 18% 
more than they did in 2021 for the same basket of 
products, further decreasing their spending power.

Despite multiple challenges, most retailers 
remain optimistic about their prospects in 
2024. An economic forecast from the Indiana 
University Kelley School of Business is optimistic 
in projecting that the economy will slow modestly 
in the first half of 2024 and then reaccelerate in 
the second half of the year. As economies recover 
from the challenges posed by the COVID-19 
pandemic, consumer confidence is expected 
to moderate in the new year, likely resulting in 
stabilized retail sales and revenue. 
Amid increasing retail competition, a well-planned 
pricing strategy is essential in 2024, with dynamic 
pricing driven by real-time supply and demand 
adjustments gaining prominence. AI and machine 
learning play a key role in informed pricing 
decisions, analyzing market trends, competitors 
and consumer behavior. Simultaneously, mergers 
and acquisitions activity in retail is on the rise, 
driven by the need for consolidation. Companies 
are merging for strength and market expansion 
or acquiring niche players for diversification and 
access to new segments.

Brands to Watch
Primark
By the end of 2023, Primark will have 24 
stores spread over eight states. Primark 
has deliberately been slow in its U.S. 
expansion to ensure the proposition 
and offers work well with American 
consumers and they secure suitable 
locations. However, the pace of growth 
is accelerating, and Primark intends to 
have 60 U.S. stores by 2026.
Grocery Outlet
Grocery Outlet’s business model is profitable 
with solid sales results. In a market where 
many consumers feel the heat of food inflation, 
the extreme-value retailer provides big savings 
on high-quality groceries and an assortment of 
private labels. The chain maintains it can open 
4,000 stores across the U.S., making it a much 
more significant player in the grocery space.
JackBe
JackBe is a new breed of physical retailer where 
consumers order groceries in-app and collect via a 
drive-thru. With its free service, the curbside drive-thru 
creates a frictionless experience for consumers. Driven 
by operational efficiencies, JackBe locations can fulfill 
some orders within 10 minutes, an anomaly compared 
to other grocery fulfillment methods. We’re likely to see 
the JackBe concept expand into other markets.

Retail Spend Forecast
In 2023, retail sales stabilized to pre-pandemic 
figures, driven by recovering consumer confidence 
and shifting spending on services. E-commerce 
maintained its growth, holding a significant 
market share, while traditional retailers adapted 
by improving in-store experiences and embracing 
digital approaches. Despite persistent challenges 
like supply chain disruptions and economic 
uncertainties, the retail sector in 2023 showcased 
resilience, innovation and adaptability.
In 2024, consumer expenditures are forecasted 
to decline slightly due to the Federal Reserve’s 
interest rate hikes. The ongoing digital 
transformation of the retail industry will play a 
pivotal role, with e-commerce sales projected 
to continue their ascent, bolstered by evolving 
omnichannel strategies. Moreover, sustainability 
and social responsibility will continue influencing 
consumer choices, driving demand for eco-friendly 
and ethical products.

Foodservice sales increased by 10% in the middle 
of 2023 thanks to customers’ higher average 
per-person spending and a shift towards more 
profitable takeout and delivery services as they’ve 
come to expect greater convenience and variety in 
food choices.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, consumers 
prefer to eat out as Americans spent 20% more 
at restaurants than on groceries, with spending 
exploding post-pandemic and growing by 18.6% in 
2022. The market for online food delivery surpassed 
$215 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow nearly 
11% through 2028, to $388 billion. Consumer 
spending growth on eating out is expected to 
reach 11.6% at the end of 2023, stabilizing to more 
normalized figures beginning in 2024.

In 2024, look for consumers to be cautious — they won’t stop spending, but they are expected to 
maximize economic value. Americans are hopeful the Federal Reserve can achieve a soft landing for the

the new year.
