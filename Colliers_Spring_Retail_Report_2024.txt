Introduction 
Our latest report delves into the 
dynamic interplay between consumer 
behavior and how retailers’ evaluate 
their growth strategy in the rapidly 
evolving retail landscape. 
We predict a slowdown in consumer 
spending in 2024, with overall growth 
slower than in 2023. This could have a 
profound impact on retailer strategies, 
as consumers are likely to form resiliency 
by being judicious with their spending 
dollars. Other factors may come into 
play as household incomes fluctuate and 
the aging population—baby boomers 
and retirees—maintain their spending 
habits despite higher interest rates. 
Retailers respond to economic 
apprehension by adopting various 
strategies to meet consumer demands 
for essential items like food and 
healthcare. Non-essential retailers 
may need to work harder to attract 
customers. As consumers retreat from 
eating out in favor of cheaper options, 
restaurant owners are worried about 
profits in 2024, and some are exploring 
AI technologies to manage employee 
costs and potentially improve efficiency.
In the context of ongoing economic 
uncertainty and market-specific wage 
increases that are exerting pressure 
on retailers and altering market 
dynamics, we examine the resilience 
and flexibility of retail brands as they 
chart their course into the future.

The Economics of 
Consumption
GDP growth and household final 
consumption expenditure analysis 
Consumer spending is expected to decelerate as 
job gains dwindle and lending standards remain 
tight in 2024. The macroeconomic landscape 
in 2024 is anticipated to be challenging and 
uncertain. Key impediments to growth include 
subdued employment expansion, restrictive 
credit conditions, and fiscal consolidation. Real 
household consumption expenditures are 
expected to grow by 1.7% in 2024, compared to 
2.0% in 2023.
U.S. cities in the Pacific, South, Southwest and 
Mountain states will see the fastest growth. 
Driven by a favorable industry mix and strong 
demographics, we forecast metropolitan areas 
such as San Jose, Orlando, Austin, and Boulder to 
achieve the most heightened disposable incomes 
and consumer spending. 
Demographic changes will shape long-term 
consumer spending. Although population growth 
may be slowing in some regions, we anticipate 
vigorous growth in most cities to come from the 
65+ age group. Baby Boomers represent a vibrant 
demographic—often referred to as the “young, 
old”— who, despite higher interest rates, have 
increased their spending, now accounting for 40% 
of all consumer spending. However, we expect one 
in four U.S. metropolises will face de-population by 
2050, impacted by economic and climate changes. 
Economic and demographic trends will 
boost discretionary spending. Given the rise 
in average incomes and aging populations, we 
forecast that urban communities will experience 
the fastest growth in spending on (mostly) 
discretionary items, including communications, 
recreation, and health. Non-discretionary 
categories, such as food and drink and housing, 
will see some of the slowest growth. 
Significant changes in household income 
distribution are imminent. New York, Dallas, 
Los Angeles, Houston, and Phoenix will account 
for 20% of the expansion for the number of 
high-income households. Meanwhile, the largest 
increases in the share of total households 
classified as high-income will occur in smaller 
regions within Arizona, California, Texas, and 
New Mexico.

Consumer Spending Outlook

GROWTH, 2024
SHORT-TERM TREND
Consumer spending growth will remain robust this year. Supported by rising real 
incomes, consumer spending growth is forecast to average 2.3% across all metros in 
2024, replicating the outturn from 2023.
1.7%
GROWTH, ’24-’28
FIVE-YEAR PROSPECTS
We expect spending to decelerate in the medium term. Despite inflation 
moderating and interest rates falling through 2027, a weaker labor market, a rise 
in the personal saving rate, and a fading boost from wealth effects will mean a 
deceleration in spending growth from 2025-28.

GROWTH, ‘24-’50
LONG-TERM OUTLOOK
Demographics impact the long-term outlook. Slowing population growth across 
major metros will result in consumer spending growth also moderating, though 
spending per head will continue to rise to 2050.

Retailers’ responses to changing 
consumer behaviors 
A strong, differentiated brand and must-have 
products mitigate the risks posed by a slowdown 
in consumption. The slowing in expenditure is due 
mainly to pressures on consumer finances, but 
there are also psychological fears over the state 
of the economy. As such, many consumers will 
budget for the products they want. Brands that 
effectively embody and promote lifestyle values 
resonating with consumers are poised for success.
Prioritize consumer engagement at every step 
of the shopping funnel. The days when retailers 
could shelve products and expect them to sell 
are long gone. Retailers that create exciting and 
stimulating store environments, forging emotional 
connections and inspiring visits, will attract the 
highest number of in-store customers. 
Retailers must adapt their business models to a 
slower growth environment. Some may need to 
curtail expansion plans, concentrating on quality 
over quantity, while others may need to rationalize 
their product offerings. Retailers who need to 
assess and change their brand and business 
propositions will be at the most risk of failure.
Watchwords for retailers in a slower growth environment

The state of the consumer
Prioritize the essentials. Amid high inflation, 
spending on essential items such as food and 
groceries, health and beauty, and clothing 
has increasingly become a high priority. Not 
surprisingly, many are frugal with discretionary 
sectors such as entertainment, furniture and 
floor coverings, electronics, and homewares. 
Consumer spending trends, consistent across 
consumer demographics, show maintained 
or increased spending on essentials while 
discretionary spending on leisure and non-
essentials wanes. Retailers, in response, must 
adjust their strategies to focus on products 
offerings that provide value-added services, 
such as loyalty programs, to enhance consumer 
retention and ensure affordability. 
Food retailers should focus on promoting 
cost-effective dining alternatives, encouraging 
consumers to switch from restaurant dining and 
takeout toward their in-store dining experiences 
or ready-to-eat meals, or alternatively, to home-
cooked options.
Adapt to rising prices. Consumers adapt to 
rising prices in several ways, from researching 
products to ensuring their purchases are more 
considered. For example, 46.7% of consumers 
indicated that they are checking and comparing 
prices online, suggesting that retailers are 
encountering heightened competition online. 
Furthermore, 42.1% of consumers reported 
switching to less expensive brand alternatives, 
with 39.2% opting for private label products as a 
strategy to manage the financial burden of rising 
prices. For retailers, implementing broad pricing 
strategies is crucial. Introducing basic ranges 
across various sectors and expanding store-
brand offerings are essential to accommodate 
the more price-sensitive consumer.
Enticed spending for big-ticket items. U.S. 
consumers harbor a generally pessimistic view 
of the economy, with 46.6% anticipating a 
deteriorating economic landscape amid monetary 
pressures. Nonetheless, 77.2% expect their 
finances to remain stable or improve modestly.

Despite this optimism regarding personal finances, 
it does not translate into heightened spending 
intentions for big-ticket items like new vehicles, 
home renovations, televisions, or furniture. 
Retailers must adopt multifaceted strategies to 
drive spending on these high-value categories. 
Options include offering pre-owned products 
to appeal to budget-conscious consumers 
and enhancing guarantees and warranties to 
affirm quality, durability, and value for money, 
particularly as consumers are hesitant to spend 
beyond necessary replacement cycles.
A growing trend, the U.S. secondhand apparel 
market grew seven times faster than the broader 
retail clothing market last year, reaching $43 
billion. These cutbacks are being felt across 
categories, as 57% of shoppers have reduced 
clothing purchases, while 40% have switched to 
less expensive clothing retailers, and 26% have 
started buying lower-quality clothing.
“American Express and Visa both reported strong first quarter 
results, surpassing expectations due to resilient consumer 
spending on travel, dining, and big-ticket purchases. Despite 
higher interest rates, affluent customers and international 
markets drove revenue growth, with AmEx focusing on 
small business strategies and Visa benefiting from robust 
e-commerce and cross-border transaction volumes.”

Views on the economic outlook
While U.S. consumers are less pessimistic than 
most other countries, there is still uncertainty 
over the economy. Considering this wavering 
confidence, retailers must exercise caution 
regarding the potential impact on retail spending 
in the first half of 2024, repositioning and offering 
competitive prices and value through discounts 
and promotions to entice shoppers to spend.
In the face of fluctuating consumer confidence, 
value-oriented retailers, including Primark, Aldi, 
Ulta Beauty, Target, and Dollar Tree, remain 
steadfast in their commitment to growth. They 
are actively pursuing their expansion strategies, 
with plans to inaugurate additional retail locations, 
underscoring their belief in the resilience and 
potential of their business models even amidst 
uncertain market conditions.

Views on personal finances
A sizable 22.7% of the population thinks their 
finances will worsen over the next six months; 
with the addition of Baby Boomers, that figure 
rises to 29.1%. 
On the flip side, Gen-Z, which are less likely 
in believing their finances will worsen, have 
channeled their non-discretionary spending into 
malls, sparking a much-needed resurgence after 
the pandemic. Despite being the first digitally 
native generation, nearly all Gen-Z shoppers still 
prefer physical retailers, possibly to satisfy their 
need for instant gratification, at rates similar to 
those of previous generations. Nearly 50% of 
Gen-Z respondents say they prefer shopping 
in-store over online – more than any other 
generation. As Gen-Z increasingly frequents brick-
and-mortar stores, will their spending habits reflect 
genuine purchases or merely window shopping?
Views on retail spending
Most consumers (51.5%) are 
poised to curtail their spending 
on retail goods and services over 
the next two quarters. While this 
is a slim majority, it will take the 
edge off retail growth in early 
2024. As consumer debt has 
increased by 48% over the past 
ten years, the personal savings 
rate has dropped from 4.5% in 
2013 to 3.7% at the end of 2023.

Views on retail spending by category
High demand for essential categories like food, 
health and beauty, clothing, and footwear 
shows a positive trend, indicating consumers 
are increasingly prioritizing well-being, health, 
and basic needs. Although foot traffic declined 
in most retail segments in the U.S. in 2023, 
some sectors, including auto part stores and 
cosmetics, saw a jump. This uptick in cosmetics 
sales may also reflect the lipstick economy, 
where even amidst economic uncertainties, 
consumers still find room in their budgets for 
small luxuries. 
Retailers focusing on non-food items may need 
help in enticing shoppers to spend. Analysts no 
longer predict a solid recession for the second 
half of 2024. However, there is an expectation for 
consumer spending growth to cool down with the 
hope that interest rates will normalize as we head 
into 2025.

Views on eating out
Retailers will have to work harder to contain 
price rises in 2024 as consumers become 
more resistant and less loyal to brands with 
expensive products. Many retailers were forced 
to raise prices in 2022 due to a high inflationary 
environment, and they have gone into 2024 with 
the expectation of keeping prices the same even 
as U.S. costs have stabilized. 
Consumers, attuned to the higher dining out costs, 
have increasingly scaled back their spending. A 
large majority perceive eating out as lacking value 
for money spent. Negative perceptions are not 
limited to high-end restaurant experiences, as 
more consumers think fast food is no longer a 
cheap treat.

Sipping Success: Swig’s Strategic Expansion  
on Building a Beverage Empire.
Q&A Interview with Matt Rossi, Senior Real Estate Manager, Swig
Over the last six months, the beverage chain 
Swig has 440 franchise units committed to, with 
plans to expand into seven new markets including 
Florida, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, 
Arkansas, Nevada, and Missouri.  
On the genesis of the brand: 
Founder Nicole Tanner founded Swig in 2010 after 
being frustrated by long lines at fast-food restaurants 
and the desire for a quick drink option. Swig began 
with a single booth in Utah and has grown to over 
70 franchised and corporate stores since then. 
Swig’s distinct offering, as the Original Dirty Soda, 
has fostered impressive customer loyalty, as we 
experience growth in multiple markets. 
On competition in the real estate market: 
There is stiff competition, and you have to be 
strategic in each market and each sub-market that 
goes into identifying the best strategy for getting 
into the trade areas you want to be in. 
Everybody likes soda, and people want to come in 
and try this fun concept. The excitement around 
Swig, its newness, its success, the lines, and how 
to generate sales have impressed developers. We 
bring in families and a broad demographic mix, 
and developers are excited to bring this into their 
developments and REITs.
On choosing locations: 
Swig’s real estate strategy concentrates on each 
market individually to see what’s happening and 
explore new developments in a proven or more 
developed market, building upon relationships 
with landlords. 
Drive-thru locations have become part of our 
DNA, the idea of grabbing something quick. We’ve 
adapted that into our strategy, and we’ve been 
lucky enough to get drive-throughs in the areas 
and markets we’ve identified. We’re also launching 
concepts in alternate settings such as stadiums. 
For example, we’re the official drink sponsor of the 
NBA’s Utah Jazz. It’s about the right setting for us, 
but we want to ensure we can get foot traffic and 
have people access the store.
On how to prepare for expansion: 
Our growth plan is coupled with the sustainability 
of the business. We want to grow at a manageable 
rate, allowing for both quality of location and quality 
of service. As a company, we’re heading in the 
right direction with plans to expand our stores in 
14 states in the next few years. When you have an 
infrastructure in place—from staffing to operations 
to development, the ability to sustain this growth 
level is more palatable.   
On working with brokers: 
We work with great brokers in the markets where 
we’re expanding. They advise us on site selection 
and prioritize a subset of markets with favorable 
demographics that correlate to paths toward 
success. We then collaborate on the best method to 
enter those trade areas, seeking an existing building 
or new development that fits those parameters. 
What it comes down to are the relationships we’re 
able to build with developers and REITs as they help 
us find those end caps and build suit options that 
we love.
On progressive technologies: 
Technology helps drive our business in several ways. 
At Swig, we use AI and tech tools in our omnichannel 
strategies, social media marketing, and real estate, 
and in the Swig app to collect customer feedback. 
We incorporate AI tools into our training programs 
to train our associates to provide the best customer 
experience, ensuring our staff offers the same 
friendly service at every store.

The foodservice retailer view
There is a generally pessimistic view among 
foodservice retailers who feel that trading in 2024 
will be worse than in 2023. The good news is that 
most who think trading will worsen also think 
the change will be slight. The majority (64.2%) 
of foodservice retailers believe their costs will 
continue to rise in 2024, an expectation attributed 
to inflationary pressures and other factors, such 
as wage hikes, which challenge maintaining profit 
margins and operational efficiency. 
The state of foodservice: costs
A notable trend is emerging as the restaurant 
industry grapples with the dual pressures of 
rising wages and a shifting labor market. The 
global restaurant digitalization market size is 
forecasted to reach $29.6 billion by 2032, up 
from $7.9 billion in 2023. While pay rates for 
restaurant workers are increasing, there is a 
concurrent decrease in hours and a reduction 
in staff numbers, particularly evident on the 
delivery side. However, this shift only sometimes 
leads to higher costs for consumers. 
The key to this equilibrium lies in adopting 
operational efficiencies and digital innovations. 
Restaurants that have already implemented new 
technology reported increased efficiency (77%), 
less pressure on staff (61%), reduced costs (35%), 
and more revenue (33%).

The state of foodservice: concerns and solutions in 2024
Employee costs are among the biggest concerns 
of foodservice retailers. The foodservice industry 
landscape has witnessed a significant shift as 
AI-powered technologies pervade various facets 
of operation. Among the notable impacts, the 
management of employee costs emerged as 
one of the primary concerns for foodservice 
retailers. As AI continues its proliferation across 
industries, its integration within the food sector 
has accelerated, with restaurants and food 
companies leveraging AI tools for enhanced
