Introduction
The global economy is facing significant challenges, concern 
over high inflation is widespread and in many countries prices 
are rising faster than household incomes. Consumers are 
apprehensive about their own finances and their shopping habits 
are changing as they adapt to this increasingly volatile situation.
For this report, we started by analyzing how disposable income 
has changed in the past 12 months, and how it is expected 
to change in the year ahead. We also expected spending 
behaviors to fluctuate, so we set out to analyze how consumers 
are reacting to this difficult financial situation and in which 
FMCG/CPG categories they are cutting back, which are 
commanding more of their budgets and what the outlook is for 
the coming year. We also investigated the tactics consumers 
are implementing to save money, how they are managing their 
spending and how smart shopping is emerging as a preferred 
money-saving option.
Brands and retailers are equally navigating these challenges so 
we set out to understand how they can support customers and 
their changing needs.
This report uses global research across a selection of 18 
international markets in tandem with syndicated data from 
YouGov Profiles and YouGov Global Profiles.
Please note, our samples in East Asian markets such as China, 
Hong Kong, and Singapore are not all nationally representative 
(with some being representative of the online or urban 
population; see methodology for details).

Financial outlook – 
what does it mean 
for consumers?
S E C T I O N  1
Around the world, many consumers are feeling the effects of rising inflation and the rising 
cost of living, forcing them to cut back in areas of spending to try and balance their finances. 
As purchasing habits change, brands and retailers will have to adjust their marketing 
strategies to adapt to their customers’ changing needs.

Half globally have 
experienced a decline 
in disposable income
When we look at changes in disposable income* in the last 
12 months our data reveals that half of global consumers 
have seen it decrease (22% decreased a lot and 28% 
decreased a little) while 28% have seen no change. 
With only 14% having experienced an increase, overall, 
the negative impact on disposable income outweighs the 
positive three-fold. We can expect, in this type of scenario, 
that spending habits and priorities will change for many.
*By disposable income we mean the amount of money left after paying tax and spending on necessities like housing, and fuel.

Older consumers 
hardest hit
When it comes to changes by age groups, we can see how 
the 35+ are the hardest hit, with the 35-54 bracket having 
to also tally up their family expenses and greater financial 
responsibilities towards them. For the over 55’s, who have 
a higher propensity to be economically inactive, they are 
the most impacted by a decline in disposable income. In 
comparison, those in the 18–24-year-old bracket, who are 
more likely to still live at home are the least impacted.
Q: How has your disposable income changed in the last 12 months due to high inflation? By disposable income 
we mean the amount of money you have left after paying tax and spending on necessities like housing, and fuel.

All income levels 
feel squeezed
It seems like this difficult financial scenario has spared no 
income groups, with around 50% across all consumers 
lamenting a decrease in disposable income, and only 
the higher earning group scoring slightly lower at 47%. 
The same group also reports the highest increase in 
disposable income with 19% compared to 13-14% of lower 
income groups. The impact on spending habits will present 
a challenge for brands as they will have to compete for 
a smaller market by offering innovative ways to help and 
support their customers.

Inflationary pressures 
are wide spread
In the past 12 months all 18 countries reported have seen 
a net decrease in disposable income compared to last 
year, with parts of Europe and Canada reporting the 
biggest negative shift. 
Great Britain had the largest decline in disposable income, 
with almost two thirds (65%) of Brits stating theirs had 
decreased and only 20% of Brits stating it had not 
changed. Following closely on the downward trajectory 
are Canada (58%) and France (55%); and Denmark, Poland 
and Sweden are all recording a 54% decrease in disposable 
income. Stable disposable incomes are shown in Hong Kong 
(42%), Germany (36%) and Spain (35%). Countries where 
more than 20% experienced an increase in disposable 
income were India (25%) and UAE (22%) with all other 
countries increasing at lower levels.
With so many lamenting financial challenges and having 
spending power compromised, what are the predictions 
for the future?

Concern over the 
impact of inflation on 
spending runs high
When asked, almost two thirds globally stated they are 
worried about how the impact of high inflation will affect 
their spending in the next 12 months (62%) with only a small 
12% claiming they are not worried. Among age groups, most 
consumers are quite or extremely worried about the impact 
of high inflation, with those aged 35-54 scoring highest 
at 67%. Although those in the 18–24-year-old age groups 
have slightly lower levels of worry, it still equates to almost 
six in ten (57%).

All income groups 
are concerned about 
future spending power
Whilst we have already seen that all income groups have 
grappled with similar declines in disposable income in the 
last 12 months, concern levels differ by income groups. 
Despite more than half (53%) in the higher income group 
being worried about the impact of inflation on future 
spending which may impact the luxury market, their 
concern is less extreme than those in lower and 
middle-income groups (both 65%).

Many European markets 
among the most concerned 
Our data shows that Italy, Poland, and Spain have the highest 
ratio of concern, with more than three quarters of consumers 
worried about the impact of inflation on their spending 
power. In contrast, Denmark, China, and Sweden are the 
least worried. In Great Britain, almost the same volume of 
consumers who saw their spending power decrease in the 
last year are worried about the 12 months ahead. For most 
countries (except for Sweden, China, and Denmark), future 
concern over the impact of inflation on spending outweighs 
the decline in disposable income in the last 12 months. China 
is one of the countries with lower rates of inflation which also 
reflects in lower levels of concern about the months ahead.

Consumer 
purchasing behavior 
amid higher prices 
S E C T I O N  2
Amidst a backdrop of rising inflation and prices rising faster than income, consumer loyalty 
can be tested as price becomes the main focus and saving becomes an imperative. 
New YouGov data explores price sensitivity across products and categories, the changes 
in spending behavior in the last 12 months and the outlook for the next 12 months.
FMCG/CPG & Retail whitepaper 2023
15
Which categories are 
most price sensitive?
Faced with a tightening of their budgets, many are now 
having to reassess their priorities and spending, and they are 
becoming increasingly attentive to price. Across 18 markets 
surveyed, we explore the products and services that are 
showing increasing price sensitivity in the past six months.
Food related products rank in the top four most price 
sensitive categories with groceries the top concern for 
more than half of global consumers (55%) and three in ten 
conscious of the price of take-out food. Over a third have 
been concerned about the cost of clothing and shoes 
(35%), almost on a par with utilities (36%). Health and beauty 
products fall within the next tier of price sensitive categories 
(medicine and healthcare, 20% and cosmetics and beauty 
products 18%), along with tech and electronics, and in and 
out of home entertainment.

Which products are consumers most price conscious about? – global
Q: Thinking about the following products or services which, if any, have you been the most price-conscious about in the past 
six months? Please select all that apply. By price-conscious, we mean being sensitive to price increases and changing your 
behaviors (changing brands, shopping around, not buying at all etc.) when prices go up.
With price sensitivity increasing across a number of products, 
brands and retailers will have to actively engage in pricing 
activities and leverage their customer-based brand equity to 
stay afloat in the middle of this storm.

Food and household 
supplies have 
experienced the 
highest increase 
in spend over 
the past 12 months 
So, how has spend changed in the past 12 months? 
Our data reveals that food and household supplies have 
experienced the highest increase in spend, with almost 
half having spent more on food and beverages (48%), 
and over a third having increased their spend on household 
supplies and toiletries (37%). This shift could be due to 
increasing prices due to supply chain issues and increased 
fuel prices, or a tendency to prefer more affordable home 
cooking to take-away options.
Purchasing behavior for apparel revealed a mixed bag of 
shopping habits, with almost the same number of consumers 
claiming they have decreased, maintained, or increased their 
spend (33%, 33% and 30% respectively). The categories of 
apparel, alcohol and toys/puzzles all see higher proportions 
of people decreasing their spend compared to increasing, 
with a third maintaining their spend.

Spend on food and 
beverages has increased 
most for those aged 55+ 
Across age cohorts, we see some variation in spending 
patterns. Whilst all age groups have felt the pressure of 
increased spend for food and beverages, for those aged 55+ 
spend has increased the most. They are also more likely than 
other age groups to have spent more on other household 
essentials such as household supplies and toiletries. In 
comparison, younger shoppers aged 18-24 are more likely to 
have spent more on personal care/beauty, apparel, 
and alcohol and less on household supplies. Younger adults 
have also reported increased spend for entertainment 
products such as toys/puzzles/games and books along with 
consumers aged 25–44 who are most likely to have younger 
children in the household.

Three in ten buyers are intending to spend more on essential 
items such as food and beverages, confirming the trend of 
the past 12 months, with more than four in ten expecting to  
 
 
maintain their current spend. Although just under one in 
four buyers are cutting spend on essentials such as groceries

Consumers 
planning to 
spend less on

As the cost-of-living continues to bite, almost four in ten 
globally (39%) are planning to reduce spend on apparel 
in the next 12 months, almost twice as many as those who 
intend to spend more (21%), with a third (34%) maintaining 
their spend. Overall, this is a net decrease on planned 
spending compared to last year.
The personal care and beauty category fares slightly better 
than fashion with a lower proportion intending to curb their 
spend in the next 12 months (31%), 42% sustaining 
the same level of spend, and a fifth plan to increase (21%). 
Amongst buyers, alcohol spend looks set to be the most 
affected with four in ten intending to reduce their spend. 
More than a third also intend to cut back their spend on 
toys/puzzles/games and books.

Whether it’s cutting back on spending across categories, shifting to private label 
alternatives, switching to cheaper retailers, or buying more value or promotional 
products, consumers are now resorting to a number of tactics to save money and 
manage their spend in such uncertain times. Brands and retailers now have a mandate

Consumers are looking 
for cheaper alternatives 
on essential items
With food and beverages highlighted as the most price 
sensitive category, loyalty is tested as customers seek to 
buy alternative cheaper brands or shop at budget/cheaper 
stores. This could mean buying a smaller size, 
a less expensive brand, or a private-label alternative. 
They are also open to trading down on quality and 
keeping to a tight budget.

Apparel and health 
and beauty buyers are 
looking for bargains 
When it comes to clothing, customers are slightly less likely 
to compromise on quality and look for cheaper alternatives 
or to shop at a cheaper store, however a third would opt 
to go without buying the item altogether. For brands this 
presents a clear challenge as promotions and discounts 
greatly affect their margins but might be necessary to 
convince customers to stick with the brand. 
Toys/puzzles/games and book buyers are also looking 
for a competitive price. They over index on online and 
in-store price comparisons and delaying purchases until 
the products go on sale.
Alcohol purchases are being greatly de-prioritized as 
consumers are cutting back on it and almost 40% say 
they would go without.
As buyers of different categories have responded to high 
inflation in different ways to take control of their expenses, 
how do they plan to moderate their spend in the next 
12 months.

Combating inflation 
with smart spending 
in the next 12 months
Looking to the future, with almost two thirds globally worried 
about the effect of inflation on future spending, many are 
planning to make smart shopping choices to navigate the 
storm. More than nine in ten globally (93%) are intending 
to combat inflation by employing smart shopping in the 
year to come. 
Buying cheaper 
The top two future tactics center on bagging a bargain 
and buying products at a cheaper price by either 
comparing prices across retail channels or waiting for the 
price of products to be slashed in sales or on sale days.  
 
Using discount codes to apply a reduction in price is 
also popular, along with buying more products such 
as ‘Buy one/get one free’ offers (BOGOF).

Trading down
Limiting spend
Switching brands or buying cheaper alternatives is another 
core strategy global consumers are intending to action to 
reduce costs. Around four in ten would switch and buy a 
cheaper alternative brand or shop at a budget/cheaper store. 
This may mean switching to value or own label options or 
trading down on quality to cut costs.
By keeping to a tight budget, planning their shopping, or 
keeping to lists, consumers can have more control over 
their spending. This might be a combination of budgeting, 
reducing spend in some categories or simply doing without 
to save money on their shopping. 
Whatever the strategy, it will be important for brands and 
retailers to show empathy with their consumers and align 
their rewards, offers, discounts and ranges to create an 
affinity with their customers and support them where they 
need it most.

Global consumers 
are taking action 
to save money
Across all markets, 88% or more consumers intend to take 
some action in the next 12 months to save money, rising 
to over nine in ten for 14 out of the 18 markets surveyed. 
Canadians and Brits (who experienced the largest drops in 
disposable income in the last 12 months) intend to undertake 
a higher number of savvy actions than the global total in the 
next 12 months (4.5 vs 3.8 global total). Whereas, in 
China (where inflation concerns are lower), consumers 
plan to undertake fewer money-saving actions in the 
next 12 months (2.8).
As consumers globally embrace savvy shopping and 
hunt for the best deals, are different countries engaging 
with different tactics?

Tactics vary by country
Brits are opting for a raft of actions to help them save money 
on their shopping. They over index on all strategies except 
for waiting for items to come on sale. Their top three tactics 
focus on trading down to cheaper brands, optimizing loyalty 
schemes and budget management. The importance of 
waiting for items to go on sale and sale days rank as the top 
tactic in Canada and Italy and in the top three for America 
and a range of European and Asian markets. Redeeming 
and making better use of loyalty cards and schemes is the 
top action in France and Australia. Consumers in China and 
Singapore are choosing to use discount codes, compare 
prices across retail outlets and wait for sales whilst shopping 
at a budget/cheaper store is the most popular option for 
Indonesia and Poland.

Connecting 
with customers
With rising prices a key concern for consumers, brands 
and retailers will need to re-evaluate how they communicate 
value, and marketers will need to understand how to 
meet with their customers’ evolving needs with the 
right campaigns.
In exploring which forms of brand communication US and 
GB consumers take notice of from retailers, digital methods 
rank in the top three. Just over a third state branded emails 
as the top method that grabs their attention, closely followed 
by social media in the US. Whilst fewer Brits are taking notice 
of social media from retailers, it is the second most popular 
form, closely followed by direct mail and TV advertising in 
joint third position. Less than one in five take notice 
of adverts in newspapers or magazines, online newsletters, 
and billboards.
Social media is more popular with younger audiences who 
are more likely to take notice of offers via social media and 
branded emails are more popular with those aged 25-54 
whereas TV resonates more with those aged 45+ in the US. 
Ensuring messaging understands consumers’ mindset 
and responds with empathy will be vital for brands and 
retailers in connecting with customers as they navigate 
the choppy waters ahead.
Whilst changes in shopping behavior during high inflation 
and the rising cost of living poses a challenge for brands 
and retailers, it also offers an opportunity to realign 
strategies to adapt to the changing needs of customers 
and step in to support them.

Food and beverages
Price sensitivity:
Groceries rank as the most price sensitive category with 
more than half of global consumers (55%) claiming they 
have been sensitive to price increases in the last six 
months. In addition, take-out food is ranked as the fourth 
most price sensitive category, with one in three (30%) 
conscious of changes in prices.
Changes in category spend: 
Across the 18 markets, food and drink experienced the 
highest increase in spend with 48% having spent more 
on food and beverages in the last 12 months. While almost 
one in three maintained their spend (29%), a fifth spent 
less (20%). 
All age groups felt the pressure of increased spend on 
food and drink but for those aged 55+ spend increased 
the most.
 
 
 
 
Food and drink spend is set to increase further. 
Food and  beverages tops the list of most impacted 
by increased spend in the next 12 months. 30% intend 
to spend more and a quarter intend to spend less (24%) 
with just over four in ten intending to keep their spend 
on the category the same.
Smart shopping:
Saving money by buying cheaper alternatives or shopping 
at cheaper retailers are the top tactics consumers are 
choosing in order to spend less on food and beverages. 
As the most price sensitive category, almost four in ten 
global consumers are trading down by buying cheaper 
alternative brands or choosing to shop at a cheaper/
budget store.
Marketing insight:  
Staying competitive on pricing and value propositions 
whilst offering relevant ranges that cater for all budgets 
will be critical for retailers and brands to win customers 
and retain loyalty.
With rising inflation, product and brand 
loyalty can be tested as consumers 
become more price conscious and look 
to save money wherever they can.

Clothing, shoes, 
and accessories
Price sensitivity:
Clothing and shoes ranked as the third most price sensitive 
category with over a third (35%) conscious of the cost of 
clothing and shoes, almost on a par with utilities. 
Changes in category spend: 
Reviewing spend in the last 12 months, whilst 33% globally 
maintained their spend on clothes, shoes and accessories, 
the same proportion decreased their spend and slightly 
fewer increased their spend (30%). The same ratios can be 
found in the alcohol and toys/puzzles categories. Overall, 
more consumers decreased their spend on this category 
than increased, although a third maintained their spend. 
18–24-year-olds were the most likely to have increased 
their spend on clothes/shoes/accessories in the last 12 
months and those aged 45+ less likely. 
Almost double the amount are intending to spend 
less on apparel in the next 12 months as spend more 
(39% spend less vs 21%), although for a third spend 
will remain the same. 
Smart shopping:
Apparel consumers are focused on bagging a bargain 
and buying at a cheaper price, allowing them to buy 
the products they want but at a discounted price. Top 
consumer tactics for these are waiting for the sales and 
comparing prices either online or in-store; they are less 
likely to compromise on cheaper alternatives, and a third 
would rather do without.
Marketing insight:  
Providing discounted deals around sales and sale days 
offer an opportunity to win customer attention. Price 
matching also offers a way to help prioritize consumers’ 
time and wallets and avoid them shopping around for 
better deals.

Personal care and beauty
Price sensitivity:
A fifth of consumers globally are price sensitive about 
medicine and healthcare products, and 18% are sensitive 
to price changes for cosmetics and beauty products.
Changes in category spend: 
In exploring spend in the last 12 months a slightly 
higher proportion increased their spend than 
decreased (31% spent more compared to 26% spent 
less) whilst almost four in ten globally didn’t change 
their in the last 12 months.
Spend increased the most amongst younger age groups, 
35% of 18–24-year-olds spent more on personal care and 
beauty in the last 12 months, compared to only 30% of 
those aged 55+ who spent more.
Looking to the future, although 42% intend to spend the 
same amount in the next 12 months, 31% are going to 
spend less compared to 21% who will spend more.
Smart shopping:
The top smart shopping tactic for personal care/beauty 
buyers is comparing prices online or in-store, followed by 
waiting for products to go on sale and trading down to 
cheaper alternatives or cheaper stores.
Marketing insight:  
Price matching and utilizing price-based promotions 
can help save consumers money and appeal to the 
bargain hunting mindset.

Household supplies
Changes in category spend: 
Household supplies and toiletries experienced the second 
highest spend increase in the last 12 months across the 6 
categories. More than a third spent more (37%) compared 
to 18% who spent less, and a considerable proportion 
maintained their spend (41%). 
Older age groups are more likely to have increased their 
spend on household supplies and toiletries in the last 12 
months, with 40% of those aged 55+ having spent more 
compared to only 32% of those aged 18-24.
In the next 12 months, almost half intend to maintain 
their spend on household supplies and toiletries with 
equal proportions intending to increase their spend 
as spend less (23%).  
 
 
Smart shopping:
Global consumers of household supplies and toiletries 
are opting for many tactics to save money. Like food and 
beverage consumers they are more likely to buy cheaper 
alternatives and shop at budget/cheaper stores, but they 
are the most likely to choose to buy more products on 
a ‘Buy one/get one free’ offer (BOGOF), use discount 
coupons and loyalty schemes as well as trade down on 
quality. 
Marketing insight:  
With more consumers looking for good value, price is at 
the top of consumers’ motivations, optimizing discount 
coupons and loyalty schemes along with supportive 
messaging will be key to gain share of consumers’ wallets. 
Brands that embrace value-based innovation can deliver 
meaningful, positive impact on consumers, businesses, 
and brands.

Alcohol
Changes in category spend: 
In the last 12 months, higher proportions spent less on 
alcohol than increased their spend (33% spent less vs 
27% spent more), while 34% spent the same amount. 
Amongst buyers, 18–24-year-olds were slightly more likely 
to have spent more on alcohol in the last 12 months. 
In the next 12 months, those who intend to spend less on 
alcohol are twice as many as those who intend to spend 
more (40% vs 17%), 36% will spend the same amount.
Smart shopping:
Alcohol has been highlighted as a category where 
consumers are making more selective choices with some  
 
 
reducing their spend due to inflationary pressures. 
The top tactic they have adopted to save money is to 
do without, overall, they are less likely to opt for the other 
smart shopping strategies posing challenging conditions 
for drinks brands and manufacturers.
Marketing insight:  
For drinks brands, manufacturers, and retailers they 
will need to look beyond price to adapt to the changes 
in consumer behavior. Appealing to new at home 
drinking experiences and continue to bring innovation 
in the form of new product portfolio offerings such as 
low and no alcohol can help keep consumers engaged 
with the category.

Toys/puzzles/ 
games and books
Changes in category spend:  
Although more than a third globally spent the same 
amount on toys/puzzles/games and books in the last 12 
months (36%), higher proportions reduced their spend 
than increased it (32% spent less and 23% spent more). 
Increased spend was highest amongst under 45s.
Similar proportions intend to spend the same amount on 
toys/puzzles/games and books in the coming 12 months 
compared to the previous 12 months. 
Looking ahead, the percentage intending to spend less 
on toys/puzzles/games and books (37%), is twice as high 
as the proportion who intend to spend more (17%).
Smart shopping: 
Comparing prices online or in-store and waiting for items 
to come on sale are the top tactics for toys/puzzles/games 
and books buyers who are looking to buy items at the most 
competitive price.
Marketing insight:  
Being fair and transparent with pricing and communicating 
competitiveness such as price matching will be important 
to build a deeper connection with customers and enhance 
brand loyalty.

Summary
Inflation concerns are very real and as consumers change 
their spending habits to offset rising costs, brands and 
retailers will have to adapt their marketing strategies to 
changing consumer needs.
Groceries and fashion rank in the top categories that global 
consumers are most price sensitive to and the ones most 
at risk of eroding brand loyalty and high competition. Being 
fair and transparent with pricing and value propositions will 
be key for retailers and brands to be viewed positively in 
the eyes of the consumer and prevail over the competition.
Remaining competitive on pricing and value propositions 
whilst offering relevant ranges that cater for all budgets will 
be critical for retailers and brands especially in categories 
where spend is being cut back.
Consumers are combating inflation with smart 
spending, with more than nine in ten choosing smart 
shopping actions in the last 12 months and plan to 
in the next 12 months.
Understanding the motivations and tactics of smart 
shoppers such as relying on loyalty offers, discount codes, 
buying cheaper brands, shopping at cheaper stores, and 
comparing prices across retail channels will help brands 
and retailers to create long-term brand affinity with their 
customers and support them through this storm.
Brands and retailers that show empathy to their 
consumers by tuning into the current financial 
environment, anticipating, and meeting customer 
expectations will build a deeper connection with 
customers and foster customer loyalty.
Marketers will need to communicate value messaging 
in an open and sensitive way and be aware of the needs 
of different customers by devising tailored messaging and 
pricing strategies to meet the evolving needs of customers 
as they navigate these challenging times.

CPG categories consumers are cutting back - or spending more on - and investigates the tactics 
consumers are implementing to save money.

is adjusted with mild weighting using interlocking demographic characteristics—methodology 
considered advanced in the market research space. For this report the following population
